## Background

The average return from investing in the S&P 500 is around 10% annually. Beating the market in the 
equity markets is notoriously hard - some would say impossible. Interestingly, in the crypto markets 
there exists a lot of opportunity to earn yield that beats the S&P while hedging against the downside. 
This project will allow users to view the current and historical yields for some of these strategies. 



## Functionality & MVPs

In Crypto Strategies Tracker, users will be able to:

1) Browse featured multi-part strategies. Click on buttons to view pros, cons, a description, and a dropdown to select a specific strategy from the category.


2) The user can view historical performence of the selected strategy on a graph. 

3) The User can select different price points and APRs for the assets involved and see how 
arbitrary price movements would effect value of the position. For example the user can see what the value of his position 
would be if he enters a hedged liquidity provision position for an eth/matic pair at the current prices and ether falls 25%.


## Libraries and APIs

1) Webpack to bundle the code

2) npm to manage dependencies.

3) D3 library to create graphs showing the performence of a strategy over time.


## Bonus Features

The following updates will hopefully be made in the future:

1) A backend can be built out and integrated with metamask to allow users to login.

2) Fucntionality allowing users to save strategies an set alerts when specified criteria are met 
(e.g. APR of a strategy goes under 20%)
