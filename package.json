  "description": "The average return from investing in the S&P 500 is around 10% annually. Beating the market in the \r equity markets is notoriously hard - some would say impossible. Interestingly, in the crypto markets \r there exists a lot of opportunity to earn yield that beats the S&P while hedging against the downside. \r This project will allow users to view the current and historical yields for some of these strategies.",
